Colossal-Sandbox
===============

<h2> What is it? </h2>

<br>

Colossal Sandbox was a gamemode created in 2009 by Black Phoenix. It can be found <a href="http://brain.wireos.com/?page_id=1369&cpage=1"> here. </a> This is an attempt by me (Jackathan) and my partner (τauon) to re-boot the gamemode. Since the code is mostly out of date, we aren't actually using any of the old gamemode's code. This is more of a spiritual successor. It will have 3 maps included, 

* csg_main_v1
* csg_ocean_v1
* csg_original


csg_main_v1 is a copy of flatgrass, with a small ocean, and a tower. csg_ocean is a large ocean with a small platform in the center. csg_original is the original map from the gamemode, originally called gm_wireconstruct_m.  (csg_ stands for Colossal Sandbox Gamemode)

Colossal Sandbox makes all players, physics props, and physics constraints all 86x smaller, allowing for a much larger build space. The main map is in excess of 16 sqkm.
